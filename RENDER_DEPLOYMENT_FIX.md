# Render Deployment Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The deployment was failing on Render with the error:
```
sh: 1: react-scripts: not found
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because `react-scripts` was listed in `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies` in the `client/package.json` file. During production builds on Render, `devDependencies` are typically not installed, causing the build to fail.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Moved react-scripts to dependencies
**File:** `client/package.json`
- Moved `react-scripts` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`
- This ensures `react-scripts` is available during production builds

### 2. Updated render.yaml
**File:** `render.yaml`
- Simplified build command to: `npm install && npm run build:client`
- This ensures a clean, straightforward build process

### 3. Added .npmrc configuration
**File:** `.npmrc`
- Set `production=false` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Added `legacy-peer-deps=true` to avoid peer dependency conflicts
- Increased `fetch-timeout` for slow networks

### 4. Improved build scripts
**File:** `package.json` (root)
- Updated `build:client` script to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Added `render-postbuild` script for Render-specific builds
- Simplified build process for better reliability

## Deployment Steps

### For Render Platform:

1. **Connect your GitHub repository** to Render
2. **Configure environment variables** in Render dashboard:
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
   - `PORT`: 10000
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret key
   - `REDIS_URL`: Your Redis connection string
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`: Your Razorpay key ID (optional)
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`: Your Razorpay key secret (optional)

3. **Deploy** using the Render dashboard or push to your main branch

### Build Command:
```bash
npm install && npm run build:client
```

### Start Command:
```bash
npm start
```

## Verification

After deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Server starts successfully
3. ✅ Client files are served correctly
4. ✅ All API endpoints are accessible
5. ✅ WebSocket connections work properly

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:

1. **Check Node.js version:**
   - Ensure Node.js version is >= 16.0.0
   - Check `engines` field in package.json

2. **Clear build cache:**
   - In Render dashboard, go to Settings → Clear Build Cache
   - Trigger a new deployment

3. **Check environment variables:**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names

4. **Review build logs:**
   - Check Render build logs for specific error messages
   - Look for missing dependencies or configuration issues

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** `npm ERR! peer dependency conflicts`
**Solution:** The `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` should resolve this

**Issue:** `Module not found` errors
**Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are listed in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`

**Issue:** Build timeout
**Solution:** Increase timeout in `.npmrc` or contact Render support

## Additional Notes

- The application uses a monorepo structure with a separate client folder
- The server serves the built client files from `client/build` directory
- Make sure MongoDB and Redis services are properly configured in Render
- For production, consider using a CDN for static assets

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Render deployment logs
2. Review this documentation
3. Check the GitHub repository issues
4. Contact the development team

## Version Information

- Node.js: >= 16.0.0
- npm: >= 8.0.0
- React: 19.2.0
- React Scripts: 5.0.1
